Melonoma Detection

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma ( a type of skin cancer)

Problem Statetment

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Steps for Model Building

Data Reading/Data Understanding- We have read the data. The data has been divided into train and test folders

Data Creation for furtehr analysis - We further distributed the train data into train data and validation data in the ratio 80:20

Dataset visualisation- We visualised the data using matplotlib

Model Building & training

Data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting

Model Building & training on the augmented data

Class Distribution

Handling class imbalances

Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
